Open source project i'm working on for fun I suppose

feel free to fork, steal these scripts

these are scripts i've made for fun? and personal use

there are features within these scripts which are ready made and are just not implemented into the ui yet

i guess you can learn from this

i am debating on doing script tutorials ðŸ’€
